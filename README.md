# Hotspot-constrained helix-coil model (HCHC model)
Code related to the manuscript "The sequence-ensemble relationship in fuzzy protein complexes"

Fig1_fuzzy_phase_space.py runs the code to repoduce the results from Fig. 1 and plots the phase space of fuzzy compelxes. Different combinnations of IDP paramters can be used.
Fig2-5_hifA runs the heteropolymer model that reporduces the experimental data presented in Figures 2-5. The accompayning nmr data in .txt files contain the order paramter as a function of IDP sequence.
